## 🔬 Research

### Enhancing Airborne Drone Detection Through Micro-Doppler Radar Signatures

This research introduces a novel method utilizing micro-Doppler radar signatures to detect drones based on the unique motion characteristics of their rotors. By analyzing the micro-Doppler patterns generated by drone rotor movement, the system enhances the detection and classification of airborne objects. Advanced algorithms are employed to distinguish these patterns, providing a reliable system for drone detection. The method is especially applicable to areas such as military defense, airport security, no-fly zone enforcement, and protection against drone-based threats. The work also includes a comparative analysis of existing drone detection methods, addressing the increasing need for scalable and dependable solutions in airspace security and safety across critical sectors.
